To compute the number of connected components and loops on your paired comparison dataset:

1. Load your paired comparison data, e.g.,
 
    incomp =

     1     2
     2     3
     1     4
     2     3
     5     6

    N is the number of nodes (i.e., images to be assessed).   

2. Run function [connected_components loops triangles]= comp_betti(incomp,N). Then, connected_components  returns the number of connected components in the resulting graph; loops  returns the number of loops and triangles returns the number of triangles.
